## Getting Started with Fusion

### What can you build with it?

With these capabilities, Fusion enables you to easily create:
- Real-time dashboards
- Collaborative applications
- Offline-capable apps
- Live data views
- Complex forms with derived values

### Who is it for?

Fusion is perfect for:
- Business applications that need live data
- Teams building data-intensive applications
- Projects where data freshness is critical
- Applications requiring offline support
- Systems with multiple connected users

### What problems does it solve?

Without Fusion, developers need to:
- Write complex code to keep data in sync
- Manage caching manually
- Build their own real-time update system
- Handle offline scenarios themselves

Fusion handles all of this automatically, letting developers focus on business logic instead of infrastructure.


### When might Fusion NOT be the best choice?

- Very simple CRUD applications without real-time requirements
- Applications where caching is not important
- Systems requiring complete control over caching logic
- Projects where you cannot use .NET (Core)
